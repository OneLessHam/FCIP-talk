# CoffeeScript and Unit Testing

## Why are we here?
* web/native development
* slow standard evolution [get numbers]

## JavaScript is great
* runs everywhere (*)
* functional paradigms
* mature library support

## JavaScript is terrible
* verbose/inconsistant
* bad parts to avoid

## Enter CoffeeScript
* just JavaScript
* [get some history]

## Where is this going?
* popular/supported [get stats]
* Dropbox
* Kickstarted compiler framework

## The Stack
* Node.js
* CoffeeScript
* jQuery/underscore/Backbone
* PhantomJS
* Bootstrap

## CoffeeScript in 10 minutes
* JSON/objects
* functions
* @/this

## The environment
* Framework (Yeoman, etc) vs diy
* Cakefiles - classic build environment with separate source, output
* Server-side

## What is better?
* declarative syntax - less comments, still clear
* Great simplified versions of common JS patterns
* Class definitions
* Functions are free
* Rewarded for making nice code

## What's the catch?
* More complicated environment
* Write/debug different languages
* Need to know JS pretty well (especially @)
* long-term maintainability - dev tools don't offer much support

## Everything else is the same (JS vs CS)
* JS OO limitations
* difficult to find mature libraries - cobble them together or swallow the pill
* browser incompatibilities
* performance/experience not as good as native apps

## Resources
* [get these]


## Unit Testing

## Essential for maintainable dynamic code
* pay back some of the time savings 

## tdd to the point practical
* works for well-defined requirements
* more difficult for exploratory code
* don't be lazy and never get back to it

## good tests
* simple - test one thing, minimize dependencies
* assume nothing for expectations
* need to watch it fail

## complications
* external dependencies
* async code

## options
* jasmine
* [others]

## declarative tests
* 
## some examples
* setup/teardown
* sinon for server response

## async gotchas
* waitsfor/runs
* ensure path is followed
